 ### Technologies used:
<p>
React: React is a widely-used JavaScript library for building interactive and reusable user interfaces. It allows you to create modular components and efficiently manage the application state.
Sass: Sass is a CSS preprocessor that enables you to write CSS code more easily using variables, nesting, and other features. It helps keep the CSS code organized and reusable.
MongoDB: MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It is highly scalable and flexible, making it a popular choice for web applications. It allows efficient storage and retrieval of data.

### Key functionalities:
<p>
Furniture design: Your application enables users to design custom furniture using an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Users can select different styles, materials, colors, and dimensions to create unique designs.
Quoting and optimization: The application generates automatic quotes based on the furniture designs created by users. It utilizes optimization algorithms to calculate costs and suggest the best material and dimension options to minimize production costs.
Personalized report generation: The application offers the ability to generate custom reports on quotes, orders, and sales. Users can select desired parameters and obtain detailed and visually appealing reports.

## Application architecture:

### Frontend:

 The frontend of your application is built with React. It uses reusable components to create the user interface and manage the presentation logic. Sass is used to style the components and provide a consistent and visually appealing appearance.
### Backend:
MongoDB is used as the database to store and retrieve data related to furniture designs, quotes, and other relevant details. You can utilize a MongoDB library to interact with the database from your backend.
### Communication:
 Communication between the frontend and backend is done through a RESTful API. The frontend sends requests to the backend to store and retrieve data, and the backend responds with the corresponding results.
In summary, your CRM application based on React, Sass, and MongoDB allows users to design custom furniture, generate optimized automatic quotes, and generate personalized reports on sales and orders. This combination of technologies provides an attractive user experience and an efficient backend for data storage and retrieval.
